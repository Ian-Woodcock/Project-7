# Project-7
## Ian Woodcock
### Clojure Pros
- fairly simple compared to some of the stuff weve done (looking at there terribleness that was IO)
- I was able to find rescources pretty easily
- some pretty useful built in stuff (at least for our projects) like reverse 

### Clojure Cons
- honestly no real complaints about clojure

### Haskell Pros (might sound like a broken record of my clojure stuff but I did them back to back so my experience of the two is kind of linked in my mind)
- fairly simple compared to some of the stuff weve done 
- I was able to find rescources pretty easily, although I felt like I needed to look for more stuff overall but still counts

### Haskell Cons
- How often I needed to use colons was weird, idk why im listing this as a con but I am
- felt like I needed to go looking stuff up more frequently than when I was doing the clojure stuff
